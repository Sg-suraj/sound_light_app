Dynamic Colour Light üé®
This is a simple web application that turns your screen into a dynamic, sound-reactive light. It uses your device's microphone to listen to ambient sound or music and changes the background color in real-time, creating a simple and fun visualizer effect.

## The Problem
Listening to music or having a party in a room with just static lighting can feel a bit dull. Traditional music visualizers are often complex or confined to a specific media player. How can we create a simple, accessible, and immersive visual experience that reacts to any sound in the room?

## The Solution
Dynamic Colour Light solves this by turning any device with a modern web browser‚Äîbe it a laptop, tablet, or phone‚Äîinto a beautiful light show. It creates a more immersive and fun atmosphere for music, parties, or even just as an ambient background visual, without needing any special software.

## Features ‚ú®
Real-time Sound Reactivity: The screen color changes instantly based on sound detected by your microphone.

DJ Light Mode: Cycles through 7 vibrant colors with every sound pulse, creating an active and frequent light show.

Zero Installation: Runs entirely in the browser. No downloads needed.

Cross-Device Compatible: Works on any device that supports a modern web browser and has microphone access.
